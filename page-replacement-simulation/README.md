# Virtual Memory Simulation

## Tests

Many of the included classes come complete with tests that verify their behavior.  The tests are written to use the `pytest` package, which makes running them much easier than if you were to use the built-in test runner.  As long as you have `pytest` installed, you can execute the test suite by running `py.test` from the root of the project folder.
