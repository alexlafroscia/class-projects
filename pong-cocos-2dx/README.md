# Pong

For an interface design class, I needed to implement Pong in the Cocos2d-x framework.  I used their web-based tools to do so, cross-compiling the JS app to work on Android, which was the target platform.

A bunch of the framework files are missing here, because I didn't want to include them in version control.  However, the stuff I wrote is still intact.
