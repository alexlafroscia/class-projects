## Results

| Example | Utility Value of Root Node | Number of Nodes Visited |
| :-----: | :------------------------: | :---------------------: |
| 1       | 4                          | 12                      |
| 2       | 6                          | 11                      |
| 3       | 8                          | 19                      |


## How to Run the Code

To run the code, pass the "tree" as a string to the program as the first parameters, like so:

    $ python minimax_a_b.py "['A', ['B', ('C', 3), ('D', 5)]]"

The program will evaluate the string and parse out the value of the array.  I know that this is really dangerous normally, but in an environment like a homework assignment, I think that it's fine to assume no one is going to do anything too dangerous.
