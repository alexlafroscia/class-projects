Note: The program does not completely work.  For some reason, the `schedule()` call in the Kernel never seems to return, and the `wake_up_process` call, while called on the correct process (I verified that the waking processes matches the one that was put to sleep), states that the process is already wake.  I can't figure out _why_ this is all happening, but the code is as close as I could get everything to functioning.
